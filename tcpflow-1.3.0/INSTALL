Supported Platforms
===================

I've personally compiled and tested tcpflow 0.11 on the following platforms:

    FreeBSD 2.2.1-RELEASE
    FreeBSD 2.2.8-RELEASE
    FreeBSD 3.1-RELEASE
    Solaris 2.6
    SunOS 4.1.3
    SunOS 4.1.3 U1
    IRIX 6.5
    Linux kernel 2.0.36, glibc2 (RedHat 5.2)
    Linux kernel 2.2.5, glibc2 (RedHat 5.2 with kernel 2.2 upgrade RPMs)

Others have reported it compiling successfully under:

    Linux kernel 2.2.5, libc5

If you have any reports of tcpflow working (or breaking) on other
platforms, please let me know (jelson@circlemud.org).


Installing tcpflow
==================

tcpflow requires the pcap-dev library be installed if you wish to
perform live capture or evaluate packet rules. You can usually install
it with one of the following:

  UBUNTU: sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
  DEBIAN: sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
  FEDORA: sudo yum install libpcap-devel
  MINGW:  Sorry!  libpcap is not currently available when cross-compiling.

If you don't have pcap-dev, tcpflow will use a pcap reader that can
read pcap files but cannot evaluate rules or perform live capture.


Next, you can compile and install tcpflow like this:

   ./configure
   make
   make install

If your pcap library is installed somewhere that the compiler can't find
it, use the --with-pcap=PATH option to tell 'configure' where it is.  For
example:
   ./configure --with-pcap=../libpcap-0.4

Next, take a look at the man page to see how it works.
